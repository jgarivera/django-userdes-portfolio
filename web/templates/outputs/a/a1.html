                My favorite app is Twitter. I like it because Twitter is a simple and minimal app. I use
                it for my consumption of day-to-day information. I get to know what the current trends
                and events that are happening in society. With this, I get updated and I never get the
                fear of missing out. I also use it for educational and informational content as there
                are also professionals and influential figures that use Twitter. Twitter is a platform
                that really makes it effective and efficient to disseminate information about nearly any
                topic everywhere. I am glad this platform exists in my time. I have been using it since
                I was in grade 10 which is roughly 6 years ago. I have initially used Twitter for just
                browsing meme content. Over time, I slowly began to use the platform more intensively as
                I grew comfortable with it. I started posted updates about my life in the platform as I
                could also see it as form of an online diary.

            <p class="article-text">
                I like the minimal interface and its features. Every feature is communicated and laid
                out well. It is centered around people’s tweets and hashtags. I can tweet or give a
                short text about what is happening around me. I can browse other people’s tweets through
                following, searching and seeing what the current trends are through hashtags. Hashtags
                are like anchors for tweets that help users know what is currently trending. I like the
                underlying culture of Twitter more than Facebook. Honestly, I see Facebook as more toxic
                than Twitter. That is also one reason I grew fond of using Twitter more.
