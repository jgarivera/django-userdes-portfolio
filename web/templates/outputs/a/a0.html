                Hi, I am Jose! I live in Makati and things are fine around here. I noticed that the
                quarantine period has been speeding up time. We're already more than half-way through in
                concluding this year. I can't believe it too!

                I took computer science as my course because building and engineering software is one of
                my passions. I would love to build a tech solution that would a lot of people in their
                day-to-day life. I think through software, we can reach and change lives of many people
                in today's digital age.

            <p class="article-text">
                I had the taste of programming when I was a grade 7 student. I wanted to add my own
                content to a game called Minecraft. To add my own game content, I had to learn modding
                through Java programming. I followed through YouTube tutorials and it was a painful
                process; knowing that I did not have the foundational knowledge for Java back then. I
                stepped back from modding and had to learn everything... starting with the basic "Hello,
                World!" After that, I improved significantly and jumped to indie game development with
                my friends. I was usually the programmer then my friends were the ones making graphical
                assets. Programming is indeed a fun skill to learn. I am able to create my ideas from
                scratch. With this and until then, my interest for programming continued and strived.

                I am an enthusiastic person. I like engaging with people and hearing out their ideas. I
                love being optimistic; especially with today's pandemic period. Better days will indeed
                come. As long as we're alive, there is always a chance to see goodness prevail. I also
                like music; especially OPM. With that, I play ukulele and guitar.

                I expect this subject to be fun and interactive! I would love to learn about what makes
                a user interface and experience good. I am studying fullstack development amidst the
                quarantine period. Observingly, I like back-end development more than front-end. But, it
                would nice to learn more about how to properly design front-end. With that, I am excited
                to pick up some new skills from this subject.
